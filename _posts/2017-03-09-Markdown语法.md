## The Basics
Before I tell you about all the extra syntaxes and capabilities I have, I'll introduce you to the basics of standard markdown. If you already know markdown, and want to jump straight to learning about the fancier things I can do, I suggest you skip to the [**Markdown** preference pane](#markdown-pane). Lets jump right in.  

### 换行符
如果强制换行，需要在换行位置添加两个空格键然后换行

* This two-line bullet 
won't break

* This two-line bullet  
will break

下面是代码:

```
* This two-line bullet 
won't break

* This two-line bullet  
will break
```

### 加粗和强调

**加粗**: `**Strong**` or `__Strong__` (Command-B)  
*强调*: `*Emphasize*` or `_Emphasize_`[^emphasize] (Command-I)

### 标题
标题支持两种语法：

    标题 1
    ========

    标题 2
    --------

或者：

    # Header 1
    ## Header 2
    ### Header 3
    #### Header 4
    ##### Header 5
    ###### Header 6



### Links and Email
#### Inline
把电子邮件放在尖括号中，这样电子邮件就可以点击: <uranusjr@gmail.com>  
```
<uranusjr@gmail.com>
```

同样也实用于urls: <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>  
```
<http://macdown.uranusjr.com>
```

如果需要这种带链接的文本: [百度](http://www.baidu.com "我是百度")  
```
[百度](url "Title")` (Title是可选的) 
``` 


#### 参考风格
有时很长的url看起来太混乱,或者你想要把所有的urls放在一起便于管理。

这里是一个链接，url在本文的其他地方[我是一个链接][arbitrary_id] `[链接显示内容][自定义的id] `：  
`这个实际的链接地址可以写在本文的任意位置，一般都放在末尾[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"`

如果文本本身就可以作为一个id，那么自定义id可以省略，像这样 [like this][] `[like this][]`：  
`[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com`  

[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"
[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com  


### 图片显示
#### 显示一张图片
`![Alt文本](图片路径 "可选的标题")`
#### 参考风格
`![Alt Image Text][image-id]`  
类似文本链接，需要自定义个id，可以把图片路径放在其他位置:  
`[image-id]: path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title"`


### 列表

* Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)
* 无序列表使用星号、加号或是减号作为列表标记：
+ `+` 这里使用加号
- `-` 这里使用减号
    * 嵌套列表
        1. 有序列表则使用数字接着一个英文句点.
        2. 就像这样 `1. `
        42. 不管用什么编号，都讲按顺序显示
        1. 你可以每行都使用编号`1.`，mkdown会自动编号它们

这里是代码:

```
* Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)
* 无序列表使用星号、加号或是减号作为列表标记：
+ `+` 这里使用加号
- `-` 这里使用减号
    * 嵌套列表
        1. 有序列表则使用数字接着一个英文句点.
        2. 就像这样 `1. `
        42. 不管用什么编号，都讲按顺序显示
        1. 你可以每行都使用编号`1.`，mkdown会自动编号它们
```



### 块引用

> 你自己先断好行，然后在每行的最前面加上 `>`.  
如果很长的一个段落，不需每一行都加`>` ，只要段落间没有空行就可以 as long as
there are no empty lines between paragraphs.  
> Looks kinda ugly though.
> > 块引用可以嵌套.  
> > > 多层级a  
> > > 多层级b  
> > > 多层级c  
>
> 块引用语法和其他语法一起使用。
>
> * 列表
> * [链接][arbitrary_id]
> * 等等.

上面显示的语法是这样的:

```
> 你自己先断好行，然后在每行的最前面加上 `>`.  
如果很长的一个段落，不需每一行都加`>` ，只要段落间没有空行就可以 as long as
there are no empty lines between paragraphs.  
> Looks kinda ugly though.
> > 块引用可以嵌套.  
> > > 多层级a  
> > > 多层级b  
> > > 多层级c  
>
> 块引用语法和其他语法一起使用。
>
> * 列表
> * [链接][arbitrary_id]
> * 等等.
```
  
  
### 行内代码块
`Inline code` is indicated by surrounding it with backticks:  
`` `Inline code` ``

If your ``code has `backticks` `` that need to be displayed, you can use double backticks:  
```` ``Code with `backticks` `` ````  (mind the spaces preceding the final set of backticks)


### 代码块
使用 四个缩进空格 表示代码块.

    print('This is a code block')
    print('The block must be preceded by a blank line')
    print('Then indent at least 4 spaces or 1 tab')
        print('Nesting does nothing. Your code is displayed Literally')

I also know how to do something called [Fenced Code Blocks](#fenced-code-block) which I will tell you about later.

### Horizontal Rules
If you type three asterisks `***` or three dashes `---` on a line, I'll display a horizontal rule:

***


## <a name="markdown-pane"></a>The Markdown Preference Pane
This is where I keep all preferences related to how I parse markdown into html.  
![Markdown preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/RQEi+)

### Document Formatting
The ***Smartypants*** extension automatically transforms straight quotes (`"` and `'`) in your text into typographer’s quotes (`“`, `”`, `‘`, and `’`) according to the context. Very useful if you’re a typography freak like I am. Quote and Smartypants are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, Quote takes precedence.


### 块格式

#### 表

This is a table:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

You can align cell contents with syntax like this:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |           $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |            $1 |

The left- and right-most pipes (`|`) are only aesthetic, and can be omitted. The spaces don’t matter, either. Alignment depends solely on `:` marks.

#### <a name="fenced-code-block">Fenced Code Block</a>

This is a fenced code block:

```
print('Hello world!')
```

You can also use waves (`~`) instead of back ticks (`` ` ``):

~~~
print('Hello world!')
~~~


You can add an optional language ID at the end of the first line. The language ID will only be used to highlight the code inside if you tick the ***Enable highlighting in code blocks*** option. This is what happens if you enable it:

![Syntax highlighting example](http://d.pr/i/9HM6+)

I support many popular languages as well as some generic syntax descriptions that can be used if your language of choice is not supported. See [relevant sections on the official site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/features/) for a full list of supported syntaxes.


### 行内格式化

The following is a list of optional inline markups supported:

Option name         | Markup           | Result if enabled     |
--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
Intra-word emphasis | So A\*maz\*ing   | So A<em>maz</em>ing   |
Strikethrough       | \~~Much wow\~~   | <del>Much wow</del>   |
Underline [^under]  | \_So doge\_      | <u>So doge</u>        |
Quote [^quote]      | \"Such editor\"  | <q>Such editor</q>    |
Highlight           | \==So good\==    | <mark>So good</mark>  |
Superscript         | hoge\^(fuga)     | hoge<sup>fuga</sup>   |
Autolink            | http://t.co      | <http://t.co>         |
Footnotes           | [\^4] and [\^4]: | [^4] and footnote 4   |

[^4]: You don't have to use a number. Arbitrary things like `[^footy note4]` and `[^footy note4]:` will also work. But they will *render* as numbered footnotes. Also, no need to keep your footnotes in order, I will sort out the order for you so they appear in the same order they were referenced in the text body. You can even keep some footnotes near where you referenced them, and collect others at the bottom of the file in the traditional place for footnotes. 




## <a name="rendering-pane"></a>The Rendering Preference Pane
This is where I keep preferences relating to how I render and style the parsed markdown in the preview window.  
![Rendering preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/rT4d+)

### CSS
You can choose different css files for me to use to render your html. You can even customize or add your own custom css files.

### 语法高亮
You have already seen how I can syntax highlight your fenced code blocks. See the [Fenced Code Block](#fenced-code-block) section if you haven’t! You can also choose different themes for syntax highlighting.

### 数学公式
I can also render TeX-like math syntaxes, if you allow me to.[^math] I can do inline math like this: \\( 1 + 1 \\) or this (in MathML): <math><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>, and block math:

\\[
    A^T_S = B
\\]

or (in MathML)

<math display="block">
    <msubsup><mi>A</mi> <mi>S</mi> <mi>T</mi></msubsup>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mi>B</mi>
</math>



### Task List Syntax
1. [x] I can render checkbox list syntax
    * [x] I support nesting
    * [x] I support ordered *and* unordered lists
2. [ ] I don't support clicking checkboxes directly in the html window


### Jekyll front-matter
If you like, I can display Jekyll front-matter in a nice table. Just make sure you put the front-matter at the very beginning of the file, and fence it with `---`. For example:

```
---
title: "Macdown is my friend"
date: 2014-06-06 20:00:00
---
```

### Render newline literally
Normally I require you to put two spaces and a newline (aka return) at the end of a line in order to create a line break. If you like, I can render a newline any time you end a line with a newline. However, if you enable this, markdown that looks lovely when I render it might look pretty funky when you let some *other* program render it.





## <a name="general-pane"></a>The General Preferences Pane

This is where I keep preferences related to application behavior.  
![General preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/rvwu+)

The General Preferences Pane allows you to tell me how you want me to behave. For example, do you want me to make sure there is a document open when I launch? You can also tell me if I should constantly update the preview window as you type, or wait for you to hit `command-R` instead. Maybe you prefer your editor window on the right? Or to see the word-count as you type. This is also the place to tell me if you are interested in pre-releases of me, or just want to stick to better-tested official releases.  

## <a name="editor-pane"></a>The Editor Preference Pane
This is where I keep preferences related to the behavior and styling of the editing window.  
![Editor preferences pane](http://d.pr/i/6OL5+)


### Styling

My editor provides syntax highlighting. You can edit the base font and the coloring/sizing theme. I provided some default themes (courtesy of [Mou](http://mouapp.com)’s creator, Chen Luo) if you don’t know where to start.

You can also edit, or even add new themes if you want to! Just click the ***Reveal*** button, and start moving things around. Remember to use the correct file extension (`.styles`), though. I’m picky about that.

I offer auto-completion and other functions to ease your editing experience. If you don’t like it, however, you can turn them off.





## Hack On

That’s about it. Thanks for listening. I’ll be quiet from now on (unless there’s an update about the app—I’ll remind you for that!).

Happy writing!


[^emphasize]: If **Underlines** is turned on, `_this notation_` will render as underlined instead of emphasized 

[^under]: If **Underline** is disabled `_this_` will be rendered as *emphasized* instead of being underlined.

[^quote]: **Quote** replaces literal `"` characters with html `<q>` tags. **Quote** and **Smartypants** are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, **Quote** takes precedence. Note that **Quote** is different from *blockquote*, which is part of standard Markdown.

[^math]: Internet connection required.
